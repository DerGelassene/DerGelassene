- 👋 Hi, I’m @DerGelassene
- 👀 I’m interested in programming with c++
- 🌱 I’m currently learning openGl and glut features  
- 👨‍💻 Nearly all Projects here are some of my old ones, some of them may be in need of an overwork, some are not quite finished and there may be one or two projects who doesn't even compile or take years to start (no exaggeration). So feel free to look through, but there is no guarantee 😉
